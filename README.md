## Initial Setup
### Requirements
To get started, ensure you have:

* Power BI Desktop installed to view and interact with the dashboard.
* Basic knowledge of Power BI for customization.
* A dataset of employee performance metrics (replaceable in Power BI)
Project Installation
1. Clone this repository:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/your-repository/employee-performance-dashboard.git
 ```

2. Open the Power BI file (Dashboard076.pbix):
 ```
 cd employee-performance-dashboard
 ```

3. Data Source Setup:

  * This dashboard comes with sample HR data, but feel free to update the data source within Power BI to     suit your organization's dataset.

## How to Use the Dashboard
* **Filter Options**: Apply filters to explore data by department, job role, performance, or satisfaction scores.
* **Drill-Down Insights**: Utilize the interactive charts to dive deeper into correlations between employee attributes and performance outcomes.
* **Custom Report Creation**: Easily drag and drop fields from the field pane to create your own customized reports or tweak existing ones.
## Sample Use Cases
* **HR Decision-Making**: Identify top-performing employees or departments and analyze their contributing factors such as education or work habits.
* **Attrition Monitoring**: Use satisfaction metrics and performance trends to detect employees at risk of leaving the company.
* **Productivity Optimization**: Track changes in employee productivity and link them to potential influencing factors such as training, work hours, or job satisfaction.
## Project Design & Methodology
This project leverages Power BI's advanced data visualization and transformation features to turn raw employee data into actionable insights. 
Below is an overview of how the project is structured:

* **Data Transformation**: Initial data cleaning, deduplication, and format consistency checks were handled within Power BI’s Power Query Editor.
* **Data Modeling**: Relationships between different data tables (employee info, performance metrics, satisfaction scores) were established to ensure accurate cross-filtering and computation.
* **Visual Exploration**: Visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were used to represent key metrics. Custom visuals were created to capture specific insights like productivity index by job title.
* **User Interactivity**: Slicers, filters, and drill-down features were included to offer a dynamic user experience and allow customization of the displayed data.
## What Sets This Project Apart
* **Advanced Correlation Discovery**: The dashboard doesn’t just display raw data but highlights potential correlations between employee work habits, demographics, and their performance.
* **Optimized for Large Datasets**: Built to efficiently handle and visualize datasets with over 100,000 records without compromising performance.
* **User-Centric Customization**: Designed with flexibility in mind, this dashboard allows users to quickly modify filters and visuals to align with their specific goals.
